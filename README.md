# Variable-Access-Analizer
a DiSL profiler for getting information about instance variables usage in Java Applications

## Output Info
- CLASS : name of the class where the instance variable was declared
- VARIABLE : instance variable name
- TYPE : type of the instance variable
- READS : number of total reads for the variable (in all instances)
- WRITES : number ot total writes for the variable (in all instances)
- INSTANCES-USE-VARIABLE : number of different instances that read or write this variable
- INSTANCES-TOTAL : total number of instances for the class where the instance variable was declared

This versi√≥n doesn't include inherited instance variables and doesn't count reads or writes made outside the class where the instance variable was declared

## How to run DiSL
You can download a source or binary release of DiSL here:
https://disl.ow2.org

In the bin folder you can find the disl.py script for running the instrumentation. The basic command is:
```
./disl.py -- my-inst-path/my-inst.jar -jar my-application-path/my-app.jar
```

### Recommended options:

You can add an exclussion list:
```
-s_exclusionlist my-exclusion-list
```

Some errors may raise with the bytecode modifications that the instrumentation does.
Run your app with this option to disable bytecode verification:
```
-noverify
```
### Running the example app:
```
./disl.py -s_exclusionlist exclusion-list -- build/inst.jar -jar -noverify build/app.jar
```
